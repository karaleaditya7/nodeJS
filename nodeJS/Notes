=============
How nodeJS works

client ==>request  nodeJs_server

Request -->event queue  --> event loop --> blocking operations or Non blocking operations   

Blocking operation  ==> process --> response

Non blocking operation ==> thread pool==> return result

it is good practice to always have non blocking operation


===============

URL ==> uniform resource locator

===============

whenecever we insert something in  browser, e.g. abc.com, then evrytime browser makes GET req

POST ==> e.g whenevr we need to fill the form , we insert some info , then that info goes to db, where post methods works


GET 
POST
PUT
PATCH
DELETE


==============
Versioning

^4.18.2

4 is major release
18 is bug fix release 
2 is minor release

^ carrot symbol ==> compatible with major release i.e u cant chnage 4 , but u can chnage bug fix and minor version

~ sqiggly line ==> it means you cant change both major and bug fix version, u can only chnage minor version

sudo lsof -i -p -n | grep LISTEN


=======================

sudo lsof -i | grep <port>
kill -9 <port id>

or


sudo kill -9 `sudo lsof -t -i:4200
